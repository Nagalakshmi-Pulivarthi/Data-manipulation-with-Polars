# Data- Processing with Python Polars
This repo has two files. One explains the basic idea of Python Polars, such as how we can use it for data manipulation instead of pandas. 
I have also used one other library: Glob. This is a Python library, which stands for global. Its function searches for files that match a specific file pattern or name.
The second (main2.py) file uses the same syntax as the first example but uses complex functions to retrieve complex data, such as a customer report.
