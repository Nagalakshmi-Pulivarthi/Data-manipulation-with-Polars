# Data- Processing with Python Polars

This repo has two files. One explains the basic idea of Python Polars, such as how to use it for data manipulation instead of pandas. 

I have also used one other library: Glob. This is a Python library, which stands for global. Its function searches for files that match a specific file pattern or name.

The second (main2.py) file uses the same syntax as the first example but uses complex functions to retrieve complex data, such as a customer report like the one below.
