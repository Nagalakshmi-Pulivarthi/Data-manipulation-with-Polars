# Data- Processing with Python Polars
This repository includes two essential files:

Introduction to Python Polars: This file provides a comprehensive overview of Python Polars, demonstrating how to use it for data manipulation as an alternative to pandas.

Advanced Data Retrieval (main2.py): This file builds on the basics, utilizing the same syntax but incorporating more complex functions to extract detailed data, such as generating customer reports.
Additionally, the project leverages the Glob library, a Python tool for searching files that match specific patterns or names, enhancing file handling capabilities.
